Use WASD to move.
Use the mouse to look around.

Choose the correct path or get sent back to the begining.

The Correct path is randomised each time you start the game. (Not when you get sent back to the begining)

If you found the correct path for one room, it will always be the correct path for that room. (Unless you restart the game)
